        h1(class='fw(200)') A functional CSS library built for speed and granular customization.

        p In Elassus, the modules are customizable in every way. Want more color options? Overwrite the scss variable that contains them with your own. Don't need a particular module? Don't include it in the build. Need a module of your own? Create one using the patterns laid out in the sample file. Don't like the class name syntax? Overwrite the function that builds them with your own preference.

                    h3 Small
                    p At it’s largest, Elassus is less than 15kb gzipped. That means your project isn’t going to turn in to a bloated mess of ever growing CSS.

                div(class='p-x(3) w(4col)m')
                    h3 Customizable
                    p Other style libraries may claim it, but finding that to be untrue was the initial inspiration for creating Elassus. Finally, you can always get what you want.

                div(class='p-x(3) w(4col)m')
                    h3 Unbreakable
                    p No more having to audit your project with every small change to your CSS to see if it broke something. In Elassus you change class names, not styles.

                div(class='p-x(3) w(4col)m')
                    h3 Understandable
                    p Within minutes you’ll be reading and writing markup using Elassus. Imagine knowing the styles applied to your code without looking at the CSS.

                div(class='p-x(3) w(4col)m')
                    h3 Uniqueness
                    p Finally, the freedom to create something that doesn’t look like a billion other products out that because it was built with a popular framework.

                div(class='p-x(3) w(4col)m')
                    h3 Responsive
                    p The modules that most often need responsive breakpoints have them right out of the box. If you need more control, you can easily bend it to your will.

        h2 Getting Started
